In view of the high risks, you should only carry out such transactions if you understand the nature of the contracts (and contractual relationships) you are entering into and if you are able to fully assess the extent of your risk potential. Trading with futures, options, forex, CFDs, stocks, cryptocurrencies and similar financial instruments is not suitable for many people. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you based on your experience, your objectives, your financial situation and other relevant circumstances.
